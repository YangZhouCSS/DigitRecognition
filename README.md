# DigitRecognition
Python implementations for handwritten digit recognition using four different methods, namely Naive Bayes, K-nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, and Neural Network.
Each line in the dataset represents an image of a hand written digit (0-9).
Neural Network with 25 hidden units achieved 98.5% accuracy on test data.
